This file is about GITHUB

First we need to install git hub
To install 
# yum install github -y
after installing 
#git init
After that we need to check git status
It will be in untracked position
we need to add 1 file in it
#mkdir file
If we want to see the structure then 
First we need to install tree
#yum install tree -y
Now
#tree
Now we need to add that file
# git add "file1"
#git status
Now we need to give message stating that we added 1 file 
# git commit -m "file1 is added"
Now we need to create branches
There are two types of branches 
1>> long live: these branches we can't deleted. 
Under long live >>> Master , production branches will come under this.
2>>short live: these branches we can delete when ever we needed.
Under short live: development,testing,uat branches will come.
So, now we need to add branches
To check in which branch we are there
# git branc
To check waht all branches are presented then
# git branch -a
we need to add branches
To add branches
# git branch development1
# git branch development2
# git branch testing1
# git branch testing2
# git branch uat1
# git branch uat2
Now check which branch we are
we can transfer 1 branch to another
# git checkout development1
